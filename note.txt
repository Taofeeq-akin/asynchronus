Asynchronous Javascript is basically to deal with long running tasks that runs in the background

And commonly use to fetch data from remote server calls (AJAXS)
Alos to learn Promisses, The fetch function, async await and error handling

////////
Synchronous code, the oppporsite of asynchronouse : Codes which execute line by line without continue if previous line not done

Asynchronous code do have SettimeOut in thier call back function which makes the code execute after a task thats runs in the background finish without non-blocking or waiting for call back function to finish running 

Asynchronous means (Not occuring at the same time) in programming

*Asynchronous behaviour of a task after
1) Running a timer
2) Loading an image     // Other Example 
3) geolocation API or AJAX calls

//////////////////////////////////////////////
AJAX: allows us to commucate with web server in an asynchronous way which makes the request and response works asynchronously in the background

*The type of API wen using AJAX which he called "ONLINE APIs": This just like a normal API which allow us to request for data and get response from the web server

///////////////////////////////////////////
Getting datas about countries from a third party online APIs
Starting with old way of doing AJAX in Javascript which is XML HTTP request function

* Firstly the API we will be using for this project is called Rest country 
* Using get country by name URl to which AJAX is called second argument request.open will take

used (request.open) to open the url 
used (request.send) to send response 

// the countries may not arrive accordingly on the interface cus they load faster then each other, This makes it  visible of a AJAx asynchronous JS
