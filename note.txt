Asynchronous Javascript is basically to deal with long running tasks that runs in the background

And commonly use to fetch data from remote server calls (AJAXS)
Alos to learn Promisses, The fetch function, async await and error handling

////////
Synchronous code, the oppporsite of asynchronouse : Codes which execute line by line without continue if previous line not done

Asynchronous code do have SettimeOut in thier call back function which makes the code execute after a task thats runs in the background finish without non-blocking or waiting for call back function to finish running 

Asynchronous means (Not occuring at the same time) in programming

*Asynchronous behaviour of a task after
1) Running a timer
2) Loading an image     // Other Example 
3) geolocation API or AJAX calls

//////////////////////////////////////////////
AJAX: allows us to commucate with web server in an asynchronous way which makes the request and response works asynchronously in the background

*The type of API wen using AJAX which he called "ONLINE APIs": This just like a normal API which allow us to request for data and get response from the web server

///////////////////////////////////////////
Getting datas about countries from a third party online APIs
Starting with old way of doing AJAX in Javascript which is XML HTTP request function

* Firstly the API we will be using for this project is called Rest country 
* Using get country by name URl to which AJAX is called second argument request.open will take

used (request.open) to open the url 
used (request.send) to send response 

// the countries may not arrive accordingly on the interface cus they load faster then each other, This makes it  visible of a AJAx asynchronous JS

////////////////////////////////////////
// How the web works request and response 
Domain of the url not the real address but a name given to it, DNS: Domain name server will get us the real ip Address of the domain then sent it back to the server

2) TCP/IP (internet protocol) will be the connection btw the browser and web server, and will only be avialable for the time it will take to laod all datas from the web server.

// TCP will prepare the datas into small small size while IP will send them to the internet

3)HTTP is web server that allows the client(browser) to communicate with the web server 
HTTP methods: They are many available but the important ones are,:
1) GET: for requesting data
2) POST: to semd data
while PUT and PATCH are basically TO MODIFY DATAS

////////////////////////////
Back to Our code
WE get the naghbouring country using prvious country data.borders 

Notes i took on Promisses and Fetch Api are in my js file
Also did chaining promise and consuming promise to prevent callback hell


// Two major things can happen to wen we using fetch method, which are either to fulfill promise or reject promise.

//So we have a way of handling rejected promise which are of two types:
1) Is to pass a a second callback function in the then method which will be for rejected promise
2) Using catch method at the end of our last then method

So while using catch it will make finally method available either promise is rejected or fulfiled
